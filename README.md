# IOTA Jukebox - Prototype Software for Distributed Action Selection through IOTA Transactions, with Value Transfer Optional

This program is a large work in progress. Information will be added as it comes. This project will eventually be open-source licensed, but I have not yet set it up. However, if you are interested in this software, feel free to contact me. Though this is particular program is a simple jukebox app, the base communication features allow a wide variety of addition and tweaking for any set of activities that rely on listening for votes, with or without money attached. 

Instructions

To run the main program, use main.py. To vote for songs, use the phone_simulator.py.

Dependencies

To run this program, pyota needs to be installed. You can find pyota at https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.py
